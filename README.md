# FEUP-PFL
A repo with the 2 projects I did in the PFL class (Functional and Logical Programming).

This repository, and every other repository (I own) named in the format FEUP-COURSENAME on GitHub correspond to the projects I developed during my time as a student at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto.
